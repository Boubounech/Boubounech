## Hey you ! Yeah you, welcome to my world !

### First, a short description of myself.
My name is Alban Bernard and I am a student in computer science from France.
I really enjoy coding especially in C++, C# (with Unity) and Java (Minecraft mods)

### Enough with me, let's talk about what I do !
- Currently learning Java with Minecraft mods.
- Developped plenty of C# projets, alone or with others on Unity.
- Used Qt6 and C++ a lot in school projects.
- Created a website with Php, Symfony and API Platform.

*For the moment, that's all, stay tuned for changement.*
