## Hey you ! Welcome to my world !

### First, a short description of myself.
My name is Alban Bernard and I am a student in computer science from France.
I really enjoy coding especially in C++, C# (with Unity), Java (Minecraft mods) and Javascript (front and back end)

### Enough with me, let's talk about what I do !
- Currently learning Javascript with ReactJS and Nodejs.
- Expanded Minecraft Java Edition experience with mods.
- Developped plenty of C# projets, alone or with others on Unity.
- Used Qt6 and C++ a lot in school projects.
- Created a website with Php, Symfony and API Platform.

*For the moment, that's all, stay tuned for changement.*
